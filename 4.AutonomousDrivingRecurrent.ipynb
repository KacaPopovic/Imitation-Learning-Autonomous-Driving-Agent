The input is an image with 96x96 pixels. The test set is the same from Assignment 3, i.e. 1000 test consecutive frames. The 1000 test samples also include a maneuver.\n",

Test the model on 1000 consecutive test frames, each with a different scenario: 1. upside-down frame flip, 2. left-right frame flip and brown street color. You should generate three different videos (mp4) for each test scenario. We recommend the library _cv2_ to generate the videos. On the first case all 1000 frames should flipped upside-down, on the second case all 1000 frames should flipped left-right and final on the last case the road should be painted brown for all 1000 frames. The deliverable of the exercise are the average test accuracy per scenario plus three videos highlighting driving the car in each test scenario.\n",

For the reason, both programs have to executed under the same python script. The simulator will provide with input data the neural network, while the neural network will provide the action to the simulator. Note: if the neural network is not able to drive in the simulator, you might need to retrain the model with more data.\n",
